mirage-fpga
===========

The plan is to get Mirage running on ARM based Soc FPGAs such as the Altera
Cyclone V Soc and Xilinx Xynq devices.  

I'll keep notes and code in this repository.

We're looking at bringing up FreeBSD on these devices then running a kernel module with Mirage running in it.

After that I'll look at how we can integrate FPGA acceleration into Mirage.
